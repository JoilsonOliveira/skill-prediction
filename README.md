## Repositories

### **Main repository:** https://github.com/pinkipi/skill-prediction

If you want anything fixed pls consider donating to :b:inkie^


### **Stable branch:** https://github.com/SaltyMonkey/skill-prediction/tree/master

The one you're probably looking right now.


### **Experimental Branch:** https://github.com/SaltyMonkey/skill-prediction/tree/experimental

The "Playground" Branch, might occasionally encounter itself unusable because someone forgot a `,` or someone duplicated a function.
It also includes some QoLs for logging skills.


### **KTera-PTS branch** https://github.com/SaltyMonkey/skill-prediction/tree/KTera-PTS

Currently being work on, we still heavily require someone logging on it to advance further though(config templates will get done sooner or later to ease adding data). I'll leave a simple guide on how to log with the debugger and on what we need exactly hopefully soon, if you wanna help still, feel free to do so already.
